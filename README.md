# Portfolio2
WORK IN PROGRESS
This is a project intended as practice to clone my university's student portal. This project uses EJS, Passport, Mongoose, Express, Bootstrap, etc.
I am using what I learned from this [https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/] Udemy course to practice making websites.
